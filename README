/// DESCRIPTION ///
CONGRATS!!! You have come across Jonathan Rodriguez's TICTACTOE game.  This
game was programmed during the summer of 2018 while researching with the 
wonderful Dr. Jory Denny.  This summer, I would teach myself -- with the 
guidance of Dr. Jory -- C++, the language I would come to know and love.  The
TICTACTOE game was a way for me to practice my skills during my free time. 
While the game does work, a young Jonathan Rodriguez made some coding decisions
that were not the most informed.   

It is now Febuary 2019.  With some newly attained knowledge, I have decided to
refactor my game.  Check out the progress!  

/// UPDATES ///
26 Febuary 2019: 
-Initialization of both Git and GitHub repositories.  First commit and push 
were made.  
-Changed TextAnimation to TextAnimator, which is simply a refactored version 
of TextAnimation.  TextAnimator does not contain a string object. The class now
consists of the functions that prints with a desired animation.  Makefile also 
updated to include TextAnimator and exclude TextAnimation.  

7 May 2019:
-TextAnimation removed from all classes.  
-TextAnimation functions now take in const char* as a parameter. 
-Code now compiles and runs successfully.

7 May 2019:
-TextAnimation functions use sleep_for function as opposed to a for loop.  
SLOW_RATE and TITLE_RATE now represent time in milliseconds.
